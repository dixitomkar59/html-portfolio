    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Omkar Dixit, and I'm currently pursuing a BSc in Computer Science at Pillai College in Mumbai. 
      Although I'm in my first year, I've already made great strides in my studies, having covered C++, Python, and Java. 
      My goal is to master web development by the end of this semester.</p>

    <p>Outside of academics, I am passionate about music. I'm the vocalist and pianist in a band called Virar Fast. 
      Additionally, I've been a trekking enthusiast since childhood and have completed around 15 treks so far, 
      with a deep love for exploring the outdoors.</p>
      
    <p>Beyond my interests in tech, music, and trekking, I am deeply committed to personal growth and learning. 
      I continually strive to expand my skills, whether it's through my coursework or by exploring new hobbies. 
      This drive for improvement fuels my ambitions, both in my professional career and personal endeavors.</p>
